# Predict-resignation
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within an organization, consisting of two key phases:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
The initial phase involves conducting rigorous EDA on a dataset comprising employee information to discern underlying patterns and factors associated with resignation. By employing advanced statistical methods and visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover correlations and trends within the data, shedding light on potential predictors of employee attrition. Through this exploratory process, key insights are gleaned to inform subsequent model development.

**Machine Learning Model Training:**
Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms are deployed to construct predictive models capable of forecasting employee resignation based on identified predictors. Employing a diverse set of models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR), among others, allows for a comprehensive exploration of predictive capabilities. Each model is trained and evaluated rigorously using established performance metrics such as accuracy and f1-score to ascertain its efficacy in predicting employee attrition accurately.
